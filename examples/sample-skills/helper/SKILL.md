# Claude Helper

This skill demonstrates naming violations.

## Violations in this file

1. **frontmatter/name-no-reserved**: name contains reserved word `claude`
2. **naming/no-vague**: directory name `helper` is too vague
3. **naming/no-generic**: description uses generic terms without specifics

## What this should be

Instead of `helper/` with `claude-helper`, use specific names like:
- `processing-pdfs/` with `processing-pdfs`
- `analyzing-code/` with `analyzing-code`

## Workflow

1. Receive request
2. Do something
3. Return result
